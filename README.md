# Parche

**parche** /_ˈpaɾʧe_/ _n._ patch

Parche is a bug tracking application that enables you to discover bugs and take action. _Write buggy code with the confidence that it can be fixed later._

Parche uses the Java framework, _Spring_, on the backend and the JavaScript framework, _Angular_, on the frontend _for purely arbitrary reasons_. Parche aims to be completely flexible, while conforming to all accepted conventions and coding standards. _Except unit tests, they'll bore you to death._

Welcome to rapid, _error-prone_ development. You'll enjoy it.

_Note:_ This repository contains the frontend code of Parche.
